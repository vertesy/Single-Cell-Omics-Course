# Single-Cell-Omics-Course
A multi-week summer workshop on single-cell (gen)omics and data analysis.



## About the course

In this course we will combine lectures with on-hand data analysis to understand concepts and learn skills to understand and use already published single-cell data for your own research.



### Topics covered

- Single-Cell biology: Concepts, history and technologies.
- Single-cell transcriptomics: experimental and analytic overview.
- R-programming to explore and visualize data.
- Data analysis concepts related to high-throughput data, and single-cell transcriptomics.
- Exploring published single-cell datasets as resource.



### Date, Time & Location

- In the semester break, **before** the new semester starts in **mid-August, at the Accra campus of Uni. Ghana.**
- Details to be specified later.



### Format

- ~15 people.
- Combination of lectures (powerpoint/slide based) and on-hands programming in a computer lab / own laptop in R.
- Full-day course, 4 days a week,  2 weeks.



### Prerequisites

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with

### Topics covered

- Single-cell biology: concepts, history and technologies.
- Single-cell transcriptomics: experimental and analytic overview.
- R-programming to explore and visualize data.
- Data analysis concepts related to high-throughput data, and single-cell transcriptomics.
- Exploring published single-cell datasets as resource.



### Format

- ~15 people.
- Combination of lectures (powerpoint/slide based) and on-hands programming in a computer lab / own laptop in R.
- Full-day course, 5 days a week,  2 weeks.
- Assignments. 



### Prerequisites

- !!! In case we cannot get a computer lab, you need to bring your own laptop.
  - If you don't have one, please contact us. 
- You also need to install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) on your laptop before the course (it's free).



The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with:

- Molecular biology of the cell, especially gene expression and RNA-biology.

- Statistics.

- R programming language. 

  - > *You can learn about this free language and editor at Rstudio [here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dromney/online-resources-learning-r) and [here](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/#r-programming).*

  - If you are unfamiliar with R, you can also apply for the **[Exploratory data analysis in R](https://vertesy.github.io/Exploratory-data-analysis-in-R/)** course.



### Materials and Reading

#### Before the course

- The course might be quite steep for some of you, and if you feel we miss some basics, please go ahead to fill in the gaps so you can better follow the course!
- Introduction, and links to tutorials and books will be provided [here](http://bit.ly/Readings_SC_OMICS) if you want to brush up your knowledge on some topics.

#### During the course

- Course notes, lecture slides and programming examples [will be available on google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I8EvaKCv4bQQLhuigzF8AtG6ewe82ueQ) (and will remain so after the course).
